# Miller Compensated two stage OPAMP using SKY130 PDK
Design of miller compensated 2 stage opamp using open source SKY130PDK

# Specification
- DC Gain: 60dB
- GBW(Gain Bandwidth): 5MHz
- PDK: SKY130PDK
- Phase Margin(PM): >=60Â°
- Slew Rate: 10V/sec
- ICMR(+): 1.2V
- ICMR(-): 0.8V
- CL(Load Capacitance): 10pF
- Power Dissipation: <=80uW(this is bcs of the large load capacitance)
- VDD=1.8V

# Circuit Diagram
The circuit of an OPAMP includes a Differential Stage which contains a differential pair and current mirror. It also includes an Amplification stage to increase the gain.

# Design and Analysis
- You can check out the Design and Analysis of the OPAMP [here](https://github.com/chennakeshavadasa/Miller-Compensated-Two-stage-OPAMP-using-SKY130PDK/tree/main/Circuit%20Design%20and%20Analysis).
-  Design Overview 
   - (W/L) ratio of M3,M4 is found using ICMR(+) <br> 
   - (W/L) ratio of M1,M2 is found using GBW <br>
   - I5 is found using Slew Rate <br>
   - (W/L) ratio of M5 is found using ICMR(-) <br>
   - (W/L) ratio of M6 is found from Gain and design of M3, M4 <br>
